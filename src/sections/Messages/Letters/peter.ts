Look at you all!
You are amazing!

Did you ever think you would make it?
Well you did make it.
Be proud, be very very proud of what you accomplished.

The software engineering program is the hardest CS program.
You have learned SO much.
Now you have to take that knowledge to the next level and apply it.
Make us proud of your next accomplishments.

While graduating is a very special moment, trust me, you won't remember it, because it's only the goal.
What you will remember, for the rest of your life, is the journey.
The work, the disappointments, the work, the triumphs, the work, your instructors, the work, your friends.
Did I mention the work?

So, graduation is a tough day.
Saying good bye to the University and all your University friends is both sad and happy.
But, even if you never see your University friends again, for some reason, they will always be your best friends.

I'll end by saying:

The Angles have the phone box.
The Angles are coming
Don't Blink!
Good Luck.
