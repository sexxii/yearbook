export const text = `Dear Software Engineering Graduates of 2022,

We first met when you came to Waterloo in September 2017. It was a privilege to teach you and to serve as your Director for exactly half of your degree; one of the best parts of my job is interacting with students. I'm also extremely thankful to Derek Rayside for running the program during the unprecedented pandemic circumstances of the second half of your degree, while I was working remotely in a far-away land.

I said it in 2017 and I'll say it again.  You came in as excellent students. You have certainly gained hard technical skills; we know how to teach those, and you know how to learn them. But there are even more important aspects to your personal development. I hope that you have also gained empathy and soft skills during the past 5 years, perhaps through your interactions with your peers, some of whom will be your friends for life.

Now it is time for you to find your very own paths in the world. I hope that you will continue to grow and to become better human beings. I wish you success and happiness, and I trust that you will seek to leave the world a better place than you found it.

Patrick Lam
Director of Software Engineering, 2016 - 2019.
