export const text = `Dear 4B Software Engineering Students,

4B marks the end of a remarkable journey, a journey of learning and self-discovery. A fruitful journey is never easy. But through your efforts and dedication, you have managed to overcome every obstacle on your path to success.  For that, we are proud.

You must be eager for what is to come. As you imagine the future and plan your next steps, remember that you are stronger than you think. Do not be afraid to take risks and accept challenges. You already have all the power to make an impact in the world. An impactful life is full of obstacles and challenges, and those who overcome them will learn, improve, and become stronger than ever.

Every one of you has the potential to achieve great things. Remember to be present and open to the opportunities that unfold before you. After this term, many of you will no longer be students. However, life never stops its lessons. Life will teach you more than you could imagine. You will advance in life by what you will learn in the future more than what you learned in the past.

I wish you the greatest success in all your endeavours.

Victoria Sakhnini
Associate Director of Software Engineering`;
