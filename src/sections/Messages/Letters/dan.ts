The traditional purpose of an engineering capstone project — and SE is no exception — is to encourage you, the student, to apply what you have learned in your classes from us profs to a real system of your choice — and not a prof-concocted one — in your chosen field.

While each course is about one topic, in any project in which you participate now and in the future, you will need to apply an unpredictable subset of what you have learned in the courses, and you will have to chose what to apply on the fly, in real time, during the project. Further, you will need another subset, again determined on the fly, of what you have learned in order to make this choice of what to apply.

The capstone is typically your first opportunity to make these choices for a real project. This is true even in a cooperative education program, which most, if not all of you were in, because typically your employers have made the choices for you, in the hopes of wringing the most productivity out of you in the short durations in which you work for them.

I will let you in on a dirty little secret. The reality is that many students do not learn what the profs try to teach with lectures, homework, and exams. We profs know this secret because we were students at one time (hard to believe, eh?). Students need to actually use what is taught in a real project to really know what the prof is trying to teach. That is, the students really teach themselves what the profs are trying to teach by doing what the profs are trying to teach in their own projects in the capstone. In some cases, students discover the lessons all by themselves. So, the capstone project is where you really learned to be a software engineer.

When I saw the enthusiasm with which you presented your capstone projects on Symposium Day, I knew that the capstone projects had done their magic.

A warm congratulations on finishing your capstone projects and all your courses, particularly the SE core courses, including the one you took from me. Congratulations also on graduating with a BSE degree.

Good luck in all your future endeavors.

Live long and prosper!

Don′t behave!

If you′re ever in Waterloo, drop by and tell me how you′re doing.
