export const text = `Dear SE Class of 2022,

First and foremost, congratulations on your incredible accomplishment! It's always hard to put one's intellectual and emotional growth into proper perspective now because we are always thinking about the future and planning our next steps. Resist this temptation for a second, breathe deeply, and make sure to savour the outstanding accomplishments of the past 5+ years of you and your classmates.

Your class will always have a special place in my heart. Together we experienced the turbulence of March 2020. Later that fall your class was the first I'd ever taught online. I still think about an example from MATH213 about "overly rapid growth" which I naively likened to the spread of a virus!

I wish you nothing but success and happiness in the next phases of your life. I encourage you to remain intellectually curious and to keep an open mind to new ideas. You never know when an idea or concept might prove useful even when its utility isn't immediately obvious. You will face many problems in the future, but you have the skills and the tenacity to solve them. I look forward to hearing about your adventures. Stay in touch.

Chris Nielsen
MATH 213 & SE 380 Professor`;
