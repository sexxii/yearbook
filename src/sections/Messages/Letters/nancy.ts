export const text = `Dear SE class of 2022 -

Thank you for the privilege of teaching you SE212 in Fall 2018!  We had a lot of fun with Harry Potter's puzzle and playing musical chairs.  Although it is easy to see that those were the good old days now.  You have overcome so many obstacles.  You have become independent, resilient self-learners, who have supported each other through unprecedented times.  Congratulations on your tremendous accomplishment of graduation!

Remember when I asked you what you would remember from SE212 in 10 years?  I hope that you at least remember that you have the skills to conquer complex problems.  These skills will always be in demand.  I hope that you can use your skills to make software engineering a profession that can offer guarantees about software behaviour.

Best wishes in your personal and professional futures!

Nancy Day
SE 212 Professor`;
